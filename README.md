Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Daily thousands of customers with different demands and behavior visit Rossmann. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation.   
The business objective of carrying out this exercise was to predict the sales across all the stores for the panel data. Our aim is to create robust models that account seasonal effects as well as individual store effects in order to predict the sales. Accurate prediction of sales will help managers to stay focused on whatâ€™s most important to them: their customers and their teams!
